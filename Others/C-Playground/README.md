# 🧩 C-Playground

Welcome to **C-Playground** — a personal space to explore, experiment, and improve my C programming skills.  
Here I implement algorithms, test language features, and work on small projects related to low-level and system programming.

## 🧠 About This Folder
This directory serves as a **sandbox** for learning and practicing C concepts covered in my Computer Science degree and beyond.  
Each program is focused on a specific topic or idea — from simple recursion to process management and memory handling.

---

## 🧰 Topics Explored
- Fundamentals of C syntax and compilation  
- Control structures and recursion  
- Arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory  
- Structs and modular programming  
- File I/O operations  
- Process management and system calls (`fork`, `exec`, etc.)  
- Parallelism and optimization (OpenMP experiments)

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run
You can compile any program using `gcc` or `clang` from the terminal:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

If your program uses math functions, remember to link the math library:
```bash
gcc filename.c -lm -o output
./output
```

## 🧩 Purpose
This folder is meant to be:
- A **practical notebook** for testing and debugging ideas in C  
- A **reference library** for reusable code snippets  
- A **learning space** to deepen understanding of how computers work at a low level
