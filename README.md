### 📚 About This Repository
This repository serves as a **personal lab** where I apply concepts from my degree in Computer Science and from independent learning platforms such as edX and Coursera.  
Each project reflects my curiosity, problem-solving skills, and passion for building clean, efficient, and functional software.
